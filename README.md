# Introduction

### Problem Statement
There are a lot of produce items priced by the pound. Unfortunately, many grocery stores have outdated methods of processing fruits and vegetables at checkout. Typically, a cashier manually inputs a code identifying the product, or customers (at self checkout) must select the produce name they are purchasing on the self checkout touch screen. These methods are very outdated. It is imperative to create a machine that will accurately recognize specific fruits and vegetables to accelerate the process.  

### Audience
- Grocery Stakeholders
- Self-Checkout Users
- Cashiers

### Why Do We Care?
- Save time and time is money
- Could perform better than humnas (potentially remove human error)

### Success Metric 
- Multi Class Confusion Matrix
- We must focus on all the predictions that are wrong (since there is chance of skeing the grocery revenue)
- It's illegal to overcharge customers and detrimental for companies to undercharge customers

### Data Science
- Kaggle (~25,000 fruits and vegetables)
- Scrape photos on flickr
